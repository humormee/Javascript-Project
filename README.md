## Background

Slide-OH! is a sliding puzzle game. Sample images are broken up into the specified number of cards, and randomly shuffled. Players try to complete the puzzle in the least number of moves. Players have the ability to add filters to the image they are playing on.


## Functionality & MVPs

Users of the app will have the ability to:

* view the images that are divided into many "cards" that compromise of the entire image
* move cards around the board by switching places with the empty space
* reset the cards so they are randomly shuffled in an m * m square
* time themselves


In addition, this project will include:
* An **About** modal that describes any background of the app as well as how to get started
* A production README
